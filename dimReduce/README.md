# Dimensionality Reducer

The files in this folder are experiments in dimensionality reduction using neural network techniques.
1. sae.py explores a Stacked AutoEncoder for reducing the number of dimensions in a dataset to a number of features corresponding to the max in the bottleneck of the architecture. A variable learning rate is also employed as an experiment.
